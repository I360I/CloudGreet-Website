   - Mitigation: Manual refresh button available

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Phase 6: Advanced Analytics** (2 hours)
   - Customer lifetime value tracking
   - Service-specific conversion rates
   - Geographic heat maps
   - Time-of-day call patterns

2. **Phase 7: Automation Triggers** (3 hours)
   - Alert configuration UI
   - Threshold-based notifications
   - Automated reports via email
   - Webhook configuration

3. **Phase 8: Team Collaboration** (4 hours)
   - Multi-user access with roles
   - Internal notes on calls
   - Task assignment
   - Activity audit log
