# Multi-Tenant Security Implementation

## Overview
CloudGreet implements comprehensive multi-tenant security to ensure each client only sees their own data. This document outlines the security measures and tenant isolation implemented.

## Tenant Isolation Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Based**: Each user has a JWT token containing `userId` and `businessId`
- **Business ID Validation**: All API endpoints validate the `businessId` from the JWT token
- **No Cross-Tenant Access**: Users can only access data for their own business

### 2. Database Level Security
All database queries are filtered by `business_id`:

```typescript
// ✅ SECURE - Filters by business_id
const { data: calls } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('calls')
  .select('*')
  .eq('business_id', businessId)  // Tenant isolation

// ❌ INSECURE - Would expose all data
const { data: calls } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('calls')
  .select('*')  // No filtering - security breach
```

### 3. API Endpoint Security
Every API endpoint implements tenant isolation:

#### Analytics APIs
- `/api/dashboard/real-metrics` - Filters by `business_id`
- `/api/dashboard/real-activity` - Filters by `business_id`
- `/api/dashboard/real-charts` - Filters by `business_id`

#### Data APIs
- `/api/calls/history` - Filters by `business_id`
- `/api/appointments/list` - Filters by `business_id`
- `/api/business/profile` - Filters by `business_id`

#### AI & Voice APIs
- `/api/ai/conversation` - Uses authenticated `business_id`
- `/api/telnyx/voice-webhook` - Routes to business-specific AI
- `/api/ai/conversation-voice` - Filters by `business_id`

### 4. Frontend Security
- **Token Storage**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- **Automatic Logout**: Tokens expire and require re-authentication
- **Business Context**: All components receive `businessId` prop

## Security Verification

### Tenant Isolation Test
The system includes a comprehensive tenant isolation test:

```typescript
// Test endpoint: /api/test-tenant-isolation
// Verifies:
// 1. Business data access is limited to own business
// 2. Calls data is filtered by business_id
// 3. Appointments data is filtered by business_id
// 4. No cross-tenant data exposure
// 5. Analytics only show own data
```

### Security Checklist
- ✅ All database queries filter by `business_id`
- ✅ JWT tokens contain business context
- ✅ API endpoints validate business ownership
- ✅ Frontend components are business-scoped
- ✅ No shared data between tenants
- ✅ Analytics are tenant-isolated
- ✅ Activity feeds are tenant-specific

## Data Isolation Examples

### Calls Data
```typescript
// Each business only sees their own calls
const { data: calls } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('calls')
  .select('*')
  .eq('business_id', businessId)  // Tenant isolation
```

### Appointments Data
```typescript
// Each business only sees their own appointments
const { data: appointments } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('appointments')
  .select('*')
  .eq('business_id', businessId)  // Tenant isolation
```

### Analytics Data
```typescript
// Analytics are calculated per business
const metrics = {
  totalCalls: calls.filter(call => call.business_id === businessId).length,
  totalAppointments: appointments.filter(apt => apt.business_id === businessId).length,
  // ... other metrics
}
```

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Verification
The dashboard includes a `TenantIsolationIndicator` component that:
- Tests data access permissions
- Verifies no cross-tenant data exposure
- Monitors analytics isolation
- Provides security status in real-time

### Logging & Auditing
All tenant access is logged:
```typescript
logger.info('Tenant data access', { 
  businessId, 
  userId, 
  endpoint: '/api/dashboard/real-metrics',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

## Compliance & Privacy

### Data Privacy
- Each client's data is completely isolated
- No data sharing between businesses
- Analytics are business-specific
- Activity feeds are tenant-scoped

### GDPR Compliance
- Data is stored per business
- No cross-tenant data access
- Business data can be deleted independently
- Privacy is maintained per tenant

## Testing Multi-Tenant Security

### Manual Testing
1. Create two test businesses
2. Login as Business A
3. Verify you only see Business A's data
4. Login as Business B
5. Verify you only see Business B's data
6. Confirm no cross-contamination

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test tenant isolation
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/test-tenant-isolation
```

## Security Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. **Always filter by business_id** in database queries
2. **Validate business ownership** in API endpoints
3. **Use JWT tokens** for authentication
4. **Test tenant isolation** regularly
5. **Log all data access** for auditing

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Database queries filter by `business_id`
- [ ] API endpoints validate business ownership
- [ ] Frontend components receive `businessId`
- [ ] No hardcoded business IDs
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly validated
- [ ] Cross-tenant access is prevented

## Conclusion

CloudGreet implements enterprise-grade multi-tenant security ensuring:
- Complete data isolation between businesses
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Tenant-specific analytics and reporting
- Privacy compliance and data protection
- Real-time security monitoring

Each client has their own secure, isolated environment with no risk of data leakage or cross-tenant access.
