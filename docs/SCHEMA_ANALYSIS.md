# Schema Analysis for Registration Fix

## Issues Found in Your Schema

### 1. Business Type Constraint
Your schema has this exact constraint:
```sql
business_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (business_type IN ('HVAC', 'Paint', 'Roofing', 'Plumbing', 'Electrical', 'Landscaping', 'Cleaning', 'General'))
```

**Status**: ✅ We're using 'HVAC' which is valid

### 2. Required Fields in Businesses Table
From your schema, these fields are NOT NULL:
- `owner_id` ✅ (we provide)
- `business_name` ✅ (we provide)
- `business_type` ✅ (we provide)
- `email` ✅ (we provide)
- `phone_number` ✅ (we provide)
- `address` ✅ (we provide)
- `city` ✅ (we provide)
- `state` ✅ (we provide)
- `zip_code` ✅ (we provide)

### 3. AI Agents Table Required Fields
From your schema, these fields are NOT NULL:
- `business_id` ✅ (we provide)
- `agent_name` ✅ (we provide)
- `business_name` ✅ (we provide)

### 4. Users Table Required Fields
From your schema, these fields are NOT NULL:
- `email` ✅ (we provide)
- `password_hash` ✅ (we provide)
- `name` ✅ (we provide)
- `first_name` ✅ (we provide)
- `last_name` ✅ (we provide)

## Potential Issues

### 1. Phone Number Fields
Your schema has both:
- `phone VARCHAR(20)` (nullable)
- `phone_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL` (required)

We're providing both, so this should be fine.

### 2. Missing Default Values
Some fields might need default values that we're not providing.

### 3. Field Constraints
Some fields might have constraints we're not aware of.

## Next Steps

1. Test with minimal data to see exact error
2. Check if any fields have constraints we're missing
3. Verify all required fields are provided
4. Check if there are any field type mismatches
