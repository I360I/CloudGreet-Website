Subject: Never Miss Another Call - AI Receptionist for [BUSINESS_NAME]

Hi [NAME],

I hope you're having a great week at [BUSINESS_NAME]!

I wanted to follow up on our conversation about how you're currently handling incoming calls and leads. 

Many service businesses like yours are losing 30-40% of potential revenue simply because they miss calls or don't follow up quickly enough. 

That's exactly why I created CloudGreet - an AI receptionist that:

✅ Answers every call, 24/7
✅ Qualifies leads automatically  
✅ Books appointments in your calendar
✅ Sends you SMS alerts for urgent calls
✅ Follows up with quotes and estimates

Our clients typically see a 40-60% increase in bookings within the first month, and since we only get paid when you get paid, it's a true win-win partnership.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo this week? I can show you exactly how this would work for [BUSINESS_NAME] and answer any questions you have.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]
CloudGreet

P.S. We're currently offering a 30-day free trial with no setup fees. No risk, all reward.
