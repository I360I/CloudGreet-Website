## ðŸ“ž COLD CALL SCRIPT

### Opening (15 seconds)
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from CloudGreet AI. I noticed [Business Name] has an impressive [X]/5 rating with [Y] reviews. Quick question - how many potential customers do you think you're missing when you can't answer the phone?"

### Problem Agitation (30 seconds)
"Most [business type] companies like yours miss 15-20% of their calls, especially during peak hours or after hours. That could be costing you $[X] per month in lost revenue. I'm calling because we help businesses like yours capture every single call with our AI receptionist."

### Solution Presentation (45 seconds)
"Our AI answers every call 24/7, qualifies leads automatically, and books appointments directly in your calendar. Businesses like yours typically see a 40-60% increase in bookings within the first month. The best part? We're offering a 30-day free trial with no setup fees."

### Close (30 seconds)
"I'd love to show you exactly how this works for [Business Name]. Do you have 10 minutes tomorrow at [optimal time] for a quick demo? I can show you how to capture those missed calls and turn them into bookings."

### Objection Responses

#### "We don't need it"
"That's what most successful businesses say until they see how much revenue they're actually missing. Can I ask - how many calls did you miss last week?"

#### "Too expensive"
"I understand cost is important. But let me ask - if you're missing just one $500 booking per week, that's $2,000 per month in lost revenue. Our service costs $200/month. Would you pay $200 to make $2,000?"

#### "Need to think about it"
"I get it, you want to make the right decision. What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the technology, the cost, or something else?"

#### "We already have someone answering calls"
"That's great! But what happens when they're busy, on break, or after hours? Our AI never takes breaks and is always available. Plus, it can handle multiple calls simultaneously."
