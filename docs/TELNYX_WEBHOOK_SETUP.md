# üìû Telnyx Webhook Configuration for CloudGreet

## ‚úÖ YOUR CURRENT SETUP:

2. **In Your Domain Registrar (where you bought cloudgreet.com):**
   - Add A record pointing to Vercel's IP
   - OR add CNAME pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

3. **Once DNS propagates (5-60 minutes):**
   - ‚úÖ `cloudgreet.com` ‚Üí Vercel app
   - ‚úÖ Telnyx webhooks ‚Üí Your app
   - ‚úÖ Everything works!

   - Go to Voice ‚Üí Applications
   - Find your application
   - Update webhook URL to:
     ```
     https://cloud-greet-website-cxg86sl12-i360is-projects.vercel.app/api/telynyx/voice-webhook-v2
     ```
   - Update failover URL to:
     ```
     https://cloud-greet-website-cxg86sl12-i360is-projects.vercel.app/api/telynyx/voice-webhook
