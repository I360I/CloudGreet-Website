# Final Registration Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing `name` field in users table
- **Issue**: Registration API wasn't providing the `name` field required by your schema
- **Fix**: Added `name: sanitizedOwnerName` to user creation

### 2. ✅ Missing `owner_name` field in businesses table  
- **Issue**: API was trying to insert `owner_name` but your schema doesn't have this column
- **Fix**: Removed `owner_name` from business creation

### 3. ✅ Missing `business_name` field in ai_agents table
- **Issue**: API wasn't providing `business_name` required by your schema
- **Fix**: Added `business_name: sanitizedBusinessName` to AI agent creation

### 4. ✅ Missing `status` field in ai_agents table
- **Issue**: API wasn't providing `status` field required by your schema  
- **Fix**: Added `status: 'inactive'` to AI agent creation

### 5. ✅ Audit logs table doesn't exist
- **Issue**: API was trying to create audit logs but your schema doesn't have this table
- **Fix**: Removed all `audit_logs` references from registration API

### 6. ✅ Business type constraint
- **Issue**: Your schema has restrictive CHECK constraint on business_type
- **Fix**: Using exact values from your schema: 'HVAC', 'Paint', 'Roofing', 'Plumbing', 'Electrical', 'Landscaping', 'Cleaning', 'General'

## Current Registration API Status

The registration API has been updated to match your exact database schema:

### Users Table Insert
```javascript
{
  email: sanitizedEmail,
  password_hash: passwordHash,
  name: sanitizedOwnerName, // ✅ Required field
  first_name: sanitizedOwnerName.split(' ')[0] || sanitizedOwnerName,
  last_name: sanitizedOwnerName.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ') || '',
  phone: sanitizedPhone,
  is_active: true,
  is_admin: false,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

### Businesses Table Insert
```javascript
{
  owner_id: user.id,
  business_name: sanitizedBusinessName,
  business_type: business_type, // ✅ Must be one of: HVAC, Paint, Roofing, Plumbing, Electrical, Landscaping, Cleaning, General
  email: sanitizedEmail,
  phone: sanitizedPhone,
  phone_number: sanitizedPhone,
  address: address,
  city: 'Unknown',
  state: 'Unknown', 
  zip_code: '00000',
  website: website,
  description: `Professional ${business_type} services`,
  services: services || ['General Services'],
  service_areas: service_areas || ['Local Area'],
  business_hours: { /* default hours */ },
  greeting_message: `Thank you for calling ${sanitizedBusinessName}. How can I help you today?`,
  tone: 'professional',
  onboarding_completed: false,
  account_status: 'new_account',
  subscription_status: 'inactive',
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

### AI Agents Table Insert
```javascript
{
  business_id: business.id,
  agent_name: 'CloudGreet AI Assistant',
  business_name: sanitizedBusinessName, // ✅ Required field
  is_active: false,
  status: 'inactive', // ✅ Required field
  greeting_message: `Thank you for calling ${sanitizedBusinessName}. How can I help you today?`,
  tone: 'professional',
  configuration: { /* default config */ },
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

## What Should Work Now

1. ✅ User registration with proper `name` field
2. ✅ Business creation with correct column names
3. ✅ AI agent creation with required fields
4. ✅ No more audit_logs errors
5. ✅ Proper business_type values

## Testing

To test the registration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://cloudgreet.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "business_name": "Test Business",
    "business_type": "HVAC",
    "owner_name": "Test Owner", 
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "phone": "5551234567",
    "address": "123 Test Street",
    "website": "https://test.com"
  }'
```

## Expected Response

If successful, you should get:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": { "id": "...", "email": "...", "name": "..." },
    "business": { "id": "...", "business_name": "...", "business_type": "HVAC" },
    "agent": { "id": "...", "agent_name": "...", "status": "inactive" },
    "token": "..."
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Test registration with the exact schema
2. Test login with created credentials  
3. Verify all database constraints are satisfied
4. Test with different business types

The registration system should now be fully compatible with your database schema.
