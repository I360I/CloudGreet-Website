console.log('üîç DEBUGGING REAL CALL ISSUE...\n');

console.log('üìã What we know:');
console.log('‚úÖ Demo conversation API works - AI responds');
console.log('‚ùå Click-to-call API fails - Telnyx error');
console.log('‚ùå Voice webhook fails - Invalid signature');
console.log('‚ùå Voice handler fails - Can\'t find call record');

console.log('\nüéØ THE REAL ISSUE:');
console.log('You said "the call goes through but nothing happens"');
console.log('This means:');
console.log('1. ‚úÖ Telnyx call is being created successfully');
console.log('2. ‚úÖ Phone rings and you can answer');
console.log('3. ‚ùå But the AI doesn\'t respond when you speak');

console.log('\nüîß LIKELY CAUSES:');
console.log('1. Voice webhook is not being called by Telnyx');
console.log('2. Voice webhook is failing due to signature verification');
console.log('3. Voice handler is not finding the call record');
console.log('4. AI conversation is not being triggered');

console.log('\nüö® CRITICAL DEBUGGING STEPS:');
console.log('1. Check Vercel logs for webhook calls');
console.log('2. Check if Telnyx is actually calling the webhook');
console.log('3. Check if the call record is being created in database');
console.log('4. Check if the voice handler is being called');

console.log('\nüí° IMMEDIATE FIXES TO TRY:');
console.log('1. Disable webhook signature verification completely');
console.log('2. Check if Telnyx webhook URL is correct');
console.log('3. Check if the call is being stored in database');
console.log('4. Test with a simple webhook that just logs everything');

console.log('\nüîç NEXT STEPS:');
console.log('1. Check Vercel function logs during a real call');
console.log('2. Verify Telnyx webhook configuration');
console.log('3. Test webhook with a simple POST request');
console.log('4. Check database for call records');

console.log('\n‚ùì QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:');
console.log('1. Are you seeing any logs in Vercel when you make a call?');
console.log('2. Is the webhook URL configured correctly in Telnyx?');
console.log('3. Are call records being created in the database?');
console.log('4. What exactly happens when you answer the call?');

console.log('\nüéØ THE REAL PROBLEM:');
console.log('The issue is likely that Telnyx is not calling the webhook at all,');
console.log('or the webhook is failing silently, so the AI never gets triggered.');
console.log('We need to check the actual webhook configuration and logs.');
