# CLEANUP PROGRESS - REMOVING SMOKE AND MIRRORS

## COMPLETED FIXES

### APIs DELETED (Pure Smoke and Mirrors)
1. ✅ `/api/automation/follow-up-sequence/route.ts` - 320 lines of fake email/call/demo scheduling
2. ✅ `/api/sms/forward/route.ts` - Fake SMS forwarding
3. ✅ `/api/sms/send-review/route.ts` - Fake review requests
4. ✅ `/api/phone/handle-call/route.ts` - Fake call handling

### APIs FIXED (Made Honest)
5. ✅ `/api/health/route.ts` - Removed fake demo phone number generation
6. ✅ `/api/support/proactive-help/route.ts` - Removed fake demo call scheduling

### COMPONENTS CLEANED
7. ✅ `/app/components/SimpleOnboardingWizard.tsx` - Removed 180 lines of fake call simulation

## TOTAL REMOVED SO FAR
- **4 entire fake APIs deleted**
- **2 APIs fixed to be honest**
- **~500+ lines of fake code removed**

## REMAINING WORK

### High Priority - Components with Fake Data
- `/app/components/OnboardingWizard.tsx` (14 matches)
- `/app/components/CampaignBuilder.tsx` (4 matches)
- `/app/components/LeadActivityTracker.tsx` (4 matches)
- `/app/components/IntelligentLeadScoring.tsx` (5 matches)
- `/app/components/AIAgentCustomization.tsx` (5 matches)

### Medium Priority - APIs to Audit
- 20+ API files with placeholder code
- Need to check each one individually

## NEXT STEPS
1. Continue cleaning components
2. Audit remaining APIs
3. Test the complete system
4. Build real features instead of fake ones
